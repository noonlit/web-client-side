        <p>House of Leaves is one of the most disorienting and terrifying books you'll ever read.
            <a href="https://prezi.com/hhrqzwnugf2-/" target="_blank">Here</a> is my presentation about it.

        Deathless will teach you about husbands, birds, and magic.
        <blockquote>
            <p>Lebedeva's eyes shone. "Masha, listen to me. Cosmetics are an extension of the will.
                Why do you think all men paint themselves when they go to fight?
                When I paint my eyes to match my soup, it is not because I have nothing better to do than worry over trifles.
                It says, I belong here, and you will not deny me.
                When I streak my lips red as foxgloves, I say, Come here, male. I am your mate, and you will not deny me.
                When I pinch my cheeks and dust them with mother-of-pearl, I say, Death, keep off, I am your enemy, and you will not deny me.
                I say these things, and the world listens, Masha. Because my magic is as strong as an arm. I am never denied."</p>
